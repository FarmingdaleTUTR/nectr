As a developer,
I want my local development environment setup to be easy and automatic,
so that I don’t have to spend the entire day following a list of instructions. The fewer the commands, the better.

As a developer,
my local development environment should run the same exact OS configuration as stage and prod environments,
so that we don’t run into “works on my machine” scenario’s.

As a developer,
I want the ability to log into the local dev server / container,
so that I can debug things if necessary.

As a developer,
I want to work on files local to my host filesystem,
so that the IDE I am working in is as fast as possible.

As a developer,
I want the files that I change on my localhost to automatically sync to the guest filesystem that is running my development environment,
so that I do not have to manually push or pull files to the local server.
