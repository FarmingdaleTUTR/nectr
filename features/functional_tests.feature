#Feature: Test Functionality of Nectr
#  As a developer of nectR
#  I want to make sure the basic functionality I expect is working
#  So that I can be sure the server is running and I can proceed making awesome stuff
#
#  Scenario: Server is responding to requests
#    # Enter steps here
#    Given The Server is Running on "Localhost"
#    And On Port 8000
#    When I visit http://localhost:8000
#    Then I should get a 200 response
